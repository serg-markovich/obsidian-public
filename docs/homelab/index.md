## Privacy principles

All homelab services follow these principles:

- **Data minimization** — no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking on self-hosted services
- **Local first** — sensitive data stays on local hardware or private VPS, never in public cloud
- **Self-hosted over SaaS** — where possible, open-source alternatives replace commercial services
- **Separation of concerns** — public content is explicitly chosen and committed, never auto-synced
